# Command Center API

A powerful ASP.NET Core API service that executes shell commands remotely with elevated privileges. This service is designed to run commands on Linux servers, making it ideal for deployment automation, server management, and CI/CD workflows.

## What It Does

Command Center provides a REST API endpoint that:
- Executes multiple shell commands in a specified directory
- Runs with elevated privileges (root) for system administration tasks
- Returns both standard output and error streams
- Perfect for automating deployments, running migrations, managing git repositories, and other server maintenance tasks

## Features

- üöÄ Execute multiple commands in sequence
- üìÅ Change working directory before execution
- üìù Capture all output and errors
- üîß Built with ASP.NET Core 9.0
- üêß Linux-focused (uses `/bin/bash`)
- üîÑ Auto-restart on failure via systemd

## API Usage

### Endpoint
```
POST http://your-server:7262/commands/run
```

### Request Body
```json
{
  "path": "/var/www/your-app",
  "commands": [
    "git pull",
    "dotnet restore",
    "dotnet build",
    "systemctl restart your-app"
  ]
}
```

### Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "output": "$ git pull\nAlready up to date.\n$ dotnet restore\nRestore completed...",
  "error": ""
}
```

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

1. Ubuntu/Debian Linux server
2. Root or sudo access
3. .NET 9.0 Runtime

### Step 1: Install .NET 9.0

```bash
# Add Microsoft package repository
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dotnet/backports
sudo apt-get update

# Install .NET SDK and Runtime
sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-9.0
sudo apt-get install -y aspnetcore-runtime-9.0
```

### Step 2: Build and Deploy the Application

On your development machine:
```bash
# Build the project
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish

# Copy to server
scp -r ./publish/* user@your-server:/var/command/
```

### Step 3: Create systemd Service

Create the service file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/command-center.service
```

Add the following content:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=API Command Center for running elevated commands in Webserver Applications
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/command
ExecStart=dotnet /var/command/"Command Center.dll"

Restart=always
RestartSec=10
KillSignal=SIGINT
SyslogIdentifier=command-center
User=root
Environment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
Environment=ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:7262
Environment=HOME=/root
Environment=USER=root
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Step 4: Enable and Start the Service

```bash
# Reload systemd configuration
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Enable service to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable command-center

# Start the service
sudo systemctl start command-center

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status command-center

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u command-center -f
```

### Step 5: Configure Firewall (Optional)

If you need external access:
```bash
# Open port 7262
sudo ufw allow 7262/tcp
```

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This service runs as root and executes arbitrary commands. 

### Recommended Security Measures:

1. **Network Security**
   - Only bind to localhost (default configuration)
   - Use a reverse proxy (nginx) with authentication
   - Implement IP whitelisting

2. **API Security**
   - Add authentication middleware
   - Implement API key validation
   - Use HTTPS in production

3. **Command Validation**
   - Whitelist allowed commands
   - Validate paths
   - Add command timeouts

## Example: Nginx Reverse Proxy with Basic Auth

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location /command-center/ {
        auth_basic "Command Center";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
        
        proxy_pass http://localhost:7262/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Git Deployment
```json
{
  "path": "/var/www/myapp",
  "commands": [
    "git config --global --add safe.directory /var/www/myapp",
    "git pull origin main",
    "npm install",
    "npm run build",
    "pm2 restart myapp"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Database Migrations
```json
{
  "path": "/var/www/myapp",
  "commands": [
    "php spark migrate --force",
    "php spark cache:clear",
  ]
}
```

### 3. Docker Management
```json
{
  "path": "/home/docker/myapp",
  "commands": [
    "docker-compose pull",
    "docker-compose up -d",
    "docker system prune -f"
  ]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Service won't start
```bash
# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u command-center -n 50

# Verify .NET installation
dotnet --info

# Check file permissions
ls -la /var/command/
```

### Permission errors with git
```bash
# Add safe directory
git config --global --add safe.directory /path/to/repo

# Fix ownership
chown -R root:root /path/to/repo/.git
```

### Port already in use
```bash
# Find process using port
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 7262

# Change port in service file
Environment=ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:7263
```
